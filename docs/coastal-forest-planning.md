# Coastal Forest Bioregion Planning Document

## Project Objective
Create a coastal forest bioregion that:
- Extends to the actual coastline/water boundary
- Follows natural topographic boundaries (valleys, ridges)
- Uses elevation constraints to exclude high-elevation areas unsuitable for shore pine
- Has irregular, natural boundaries rather than geometric buffers
- Can be layered under water in Mapbox for natural masking

## Available Data Resources

### 1. Tree Cover Data
**Primary Source**: `/Users/JJC/trees/outputs/mapbox_masks/pnw_tree_cover_90m_mapbox.tif`
- **Resolution**: 90m 
- **Coverage**: Pacific Northwest region
- **Values**: 0-100% tree canopy cover
- **Use Case**: Exclude non-forested areas, define forest boundaries

**Alternative Sources**:
- `pnw_tree_cover_30m_full.tif` (30m resolution, higher detail)
- `pnw_tree_cover_60m_half.tif` (60m resolution)
- `pnw_tree_cover_120m_quarter.tif` (120m resolution, faster processing)

### 2. Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
**Current Sources** (need to verify):
- Cached DEM data in `data/raw/` directory
- NLCD elevation data (referenced in existing scripts)
- Possible USGS 30m DEM

**Elevation Constraints**:
- Shore pine (Pinus contorta var. contorta): 0-500ft elevation
- Coastal transition zone: 500-1000ft elevation
- Maximum coastal forest: <1500ft elevation

### 3. Cached Elevation Masks
**Available**: `cache/species_masks/pnw_elevation_mask_*`
- Various elevation ranges (0-4500ft, 0-5000ft, etc.)
- Pre-processed GeoJSON polygons
- Ready for spatial operations

### 4. Tree Species Database Analysis
**CONFIRMED**: REF_SPECIES table has subspecies fields, but they're NOT populated for Pinus contorta!
- **Primary Table**: `TREE` table with `SPCD` codes
- **Species Reference**: `REF_SPECIES` table
- **Subspecies Fields**: VARIETY and SUBSPECIES exist but are NULL for SPCD 108
- **Key Finding**: **FIA database does NOT distinguish shore pine from lodgepole pine**
- **Implication**: Must use geographic location + elevation to identify shore pine habitat
- **Shore Pine Strategy**: Use coastal proximity (<50km) + low elevation (<500ft) as proxies

### 5. Existing Coastal Species Data
**Processed Data**: `outputs/coastal_analysis/coastal_forest_plots.geojson`
- 2,234 coastal plots at <1000ft elevation
- 418 plots with Sitka spruce
- 52 plots with lodgepole pine (includes shore pine)
- Geographic range: -124.70ï¿½ to -123.00ï¿½ longitude

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Data Assessment
1. **Subspecies Investigation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT SPCD, COMMON_NAME, SCIENTIFIC_NAME 
   FROM REF_SPECIES 
   WHERE SPCD = 108 OR SCIENTIFIC_NAME LIKE '%contorta%'
   ```

2. **DEM Data Inventory**:
   - Locate and assess available DEM sources
   - Determine resolution and coverage
   - Test elevation extraction at known coastal plot locations

3. **Tree Cover Analysis**:
   - Load 90m Mapbox tree cover raster
   - Analyze coverage along known coastline
   - Determine optimal threshold for coastal forests

### Phase 2: Coastal Boundary Definition
1. **Water Boundary Approach**:
   - Since Mapbox water layer will mask the coastline
   - Create bioregion that extends into water areas
   - Let water layer provide natural coastal boundary

2. **Elevation-Based Inland Boundary**:
   - Use DEM to create elevation contours
   - Apply species-specific elevation limits
   - Create smooth transitions between elevation zones

3. **Tree Cover Integration**:
   - Apply minimum tree cover threshold (5-10%)
   - Remove non-forested areas from bioregion
   - Maintain connectivity of forest patches

### Phase 3: Bioregion Refinement
1. **Topographic Following**:
   - Use DEM to identify ridges and valleys
   - Extend bioregion up coastal valleys
   - Respect natural watershed boundaries

2. **Species Validation**:
   - Overlay known Sitka spruce locations
   - Overlay known shore pine locations  
   - Adjust boundaries to include species concentrations

3. **Connectivity Analysis**:
   - Ensure bioregion forms connected forest corridors
   - Bridge small gaps in forest cover
   - Remove isolated fragments below minimum size

### Phase 4: Output Optimization
1. **Mapbox Integration**:
   - Optimize geometry for web mapping
   - Reduce polygon complexity where appropriate
   - Test layering with water boundaries

2. **Multi-Resolution Outputs**:
   - High-detail version for analysis
   - Simplified version for web mapping
   - Point validation datasets

## Implementation Strategy

### Method A: Raster-Based Approach (Recommended)
```python
# Workflow
1. Load tree cover raster (90m)
2. Load DEM raster
3. Create elevation masks (<500ft, <1000ft, <1500ft)
4. Apply tree cover threshold (>5%)
5. Combine constraints with logical AND
6. Vectorize resulting raster to polygons
7. Apply morphological operations for smoothing
8. Validate against species occurrence data
```

**Advantages**:
- Follows natural boundaries precisely
- Integrates multiple data sources seamlessly
- Produces irregular, realistic boundaries
- Computationally efficient

### Method B: Species-Driven Buffer Approach
```python
# Workflow  
1. Create buffers around coastal species plots
2. Merge overlapping buffers
3. Clip to elevation constraints
4. Clip to tree cover constraints
5. Smooth boundaries
```

**Advantages**:
- Directly based on species occurrences
- Simpler implementation
- Easy to validate

## Data Processing Requirements

### Computing Considerations
- **Memory**: Tree cover raster (~90m) may be large
- **Processing Time**: Raster operations can be slow
- **Storage**: Multiple intermediate outputs needed

### Quality Control Checks
1. **Elevation Validation**: Check that bioregion elevations match species data
2. **Tree Cover Validation**: Verify adequate forest cover in bioregion
3. **Species Coverage**: Ensure bioregion captures majority of coastal species plots
4. **Boundary Quality**: Check for unrealistic geometric artifacts

## Expected Outputs
