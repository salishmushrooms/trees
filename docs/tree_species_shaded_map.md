# Tree Species Distribution Mapping for Washington State

## Project Status: ELEVATION MASKING SUCCESS! 🏔️✅
**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Current Phase**: ✅ Successfully added elevation constraints to Douglas Fir distribution

## Enhanced Goal
Create **large, continuous polygon areas** showing where Douglas Fir is distributed across Washington State, **constrained by realistic elevation limits**. This creates more accurate habitat modeling by excluding high alpine areas where Douglas Fir cannot grow.

**Specific Objectives:**
- Single species focus: Douglas Fir only
- Output: Large merged multipolygon areas (non-overlapping)
- **NEW**: Elevation constraints (exclude areas >6,000 feet)
- Simple presence/absence approach (not density gradients)
- Foundation for later layering of additional data

**Why This Enhanced Approach:**
- **More realistic distributions**: Excludes high alpine areas where Douglas Fir doesn't grow
- **Better habitat modeling**: Accounts for species' ecological constraints
- **Scalable methodology**: Can apply different elevation limits to different species
- Creates usable foundation layer for MapBox
- Easier to validate against known ecological ranges

## ✅ COMPLETED: Douglas Fir Elevation-Constrained Distribution

### Results Summary
- **Source data**: 4,982 FIA plots with Douglas Fir (64,515 trees total)
- **Method**: 8km buffer → merge overlaps → **subtract high elevation areas** → simplify geometry
- **Elevation limit**: Areas above 6,000 feet excluded
- **High elevation coverage**: 2.2% of Washington State identified as >6,000 feet
- **Area reduction**: 2.7% of distribution removed due to elevation constraints
- **Output**: 167 separate polygon areas (vs 13 without elevation constraints)
- **File size**: 0.9 MB (elevation-constrained) vs 0.2 MB (original)
- **Processing time**: ~15 seconds (including DEM processing)

### Technical Success Metrics
- **Elevation processing**: 1,441 MB DEM data processed efficiently
- **High elevation identification**: 8.2M pixels identified as >6,000 feet
- **Polygon creation**: 1,062 high elevation polygons merged and subtracted
- **Geometry optimization**: 88.4% vertex reduction (51,335 → 5,974 vertices)
- **Geographic coverage**: Full Washington State with realistic mountain exclusions

### File Comparison
| Version | Polygons | File Size | Area Reduction | Features |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Original** | 13 | 0.2 MB | 0% | Basic buffer-merge |
| **Elevation-Constrained** | 167 | 0.9 MB | 2.7% | Excludes >6,000ft areas |

## Technical Implementation

### ✅ Enhanced Method: Buffer-Merge-Elevation-Constrain
1. **Extract Douglas Fir plots** from FIA database ✅
2. **Create 8km buffers** around each plot (0.0721° radius) ✅
3. **Merge overlapping buffers** using `unary_union` ✅
4. **🆕 Create elevation mask** for areas >6,000 feet ✅
5. **🆕 Subtract high elevation areas** from distribution ✅
6. **Simplify geometry** with 0.001° tolerance ✅

### Key Technical Innovations
- **DEM processing**: Efficient windowed reading of large elevation datasets
- **Elevation masking**: Raster-to-vector conversion with polygon merging
- **Geometric subtraction**: Clean removal of high elevation areas
- **Memory management**: Processed 1.4GB elevation data without memory issues
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if DEM unavailable or rasterio missing

### Configuration Options
```python
# Elevation configuration (easily adjustable)
MAX_ELEVATION_FT = 6000  # Douglas Fir upper limit
APPLY_ELEVATION_MASK = True  # Toggle elevation masking
DEM_FILE = "/path/to/dem.vrt"  # DEM data source
```

## Research Context for Future Work
The elevation masking represents a major advancement in ecological realism. The fact that only 2.7% of Douglas Fir distribution was removed by the 6,000-foot limit suggests this species truly is adapted to a wide elevation range in Washington.

Key insights:
- **High alpine areas (>6,000ft)**: 2.2% of Washington State
- **Douglas Fir constraint**: Only 2.7% distribution reduction
- **Polygon fragmentation**: 13 → 167 polygons shows mountain-induced habitat fragmentation
- **Method scalability**: Same approach will work for other species with different elevation limits

For **Ponderosa Pine** (target for B. rex-veris habitat), we'd expect:
- Higher elevation tolerance (up to 8,000ft)
- More concentrated in eastern Washington
- Greater constraint effect due to more specific elevation preferences

## Key Learnings
- **DEM processing is feasible**: 1.4GB elevation data processed efficiently
- **Elevation constraints matter**: Even for wide-ranging species like Douglas Fir
- **Polygon fragmentation increases**: Realistic mountain barriers create habitat islands
- **File size manageable**: 0.9MB still well within MapBox limits
- **Method is robust**: Handles errors gracefully, falls back to non-elevation version
- **Ecological accuracy improved**: Excludes unrealistic high alpine Douglas Fir habitat

This elevation-constrained approach creates the most realistic Douglas Fir distribution map possible from FIA data, accounting for both plot-based presence and species-specific ecological limits.
